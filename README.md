# Sound Notification For Blender
This python script allows you enter an audio file to be played once you render is complete.

Just enter the file path where it says to on line 5, paste into your Script tab in blender, and hit the play button. 
So far it has only been tested for test renders by pressing F12.

Have fun with it!
